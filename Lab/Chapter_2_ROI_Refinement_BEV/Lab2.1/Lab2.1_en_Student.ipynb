    "##### **Intuitive Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "The camera mounted on the AutoCar-Kit has a low viewing angle. In the image:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The upper part is usually the ceiling, walls, people, table legs, etc.\n",
    "- The lower part is the actual road surface and lane markings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the lane-keeping problem, we only need the area near the car—meaning we only retain the bottom 40% polygon where the road lanes actually appear.\n",
    "Instead of processing the entire image, we crop a Region of Interest (ROI):\n",
    "\n",
    "> ROI = a polygon covering the area of the road surface we are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main pipeline, the ROI is defined by coordinate ratios relative to the image size, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Mathematical Representation of ROI**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the output image from the segmentation model has dimensions $(H \\times W)$.\n",
    "We denote:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $M(x, y)$: the value of the lane mask at pixel $(x,y)$, where $M(x,y) \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n",
    "- $(x_i^{\\text{ratio}},\\, y_i^{\\text{ratio}})$: the ratio coordinates of the ROI polygon vertices, where each value belongs to $[0,1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Converting Ratio Coordinates → Pixel Coordinates**\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert the ROI points to actual pixel coordinates in the image, we multiply by the height and width:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_i^{\\text{pix}}\n",
    "= x_i^{\\text{ratio}} \\cdot W, \n",
    "\\qquad\n",
    "y_i^{\\text{pix}}\n",
    "= y_i^{\\text{ratio}} \\cdot H.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the ROI is always independent of the image resolution, and only changes with the true dimensions $(W, H)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Constructing the ROI Mask**\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the binary function $R(x,y)$ — the ROI mask — as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R(x,y) =\n",

    "1, & \\text{if } (x,y) \\text{ is inside the ROI polygon}, \\\\\n",

    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is created by filling the ROI polygon on a blank image.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Applying ROI to the Lane Mask**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{\\text{ROI}}(x,y)\n",
    "= M(x,y) \\cdot R(x,y).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $(x,y)$ is outside the ROI\n",
    "  $\\Rightarrow R(x,y)=0$\n",
    "  $\\Rightarrow$ the pixel is eliminated.\n",

    "- If $(x,y)$ is inside the ROI\n",
    "  $\\Rightarrow R(x,y)=1$\n",
    "  $\\Rightarrow$ the mask value is retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Illustration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the ROI helps to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Eliminate the entire upper part of the image (where the road surface is not present).\n",
    "- Reduce noise from objects, lighting, and shadows.\n",
    "- Make the subsequent pipeline (refine mask $\\to$ BEV $\\to$ scanline $\\to$ controller) more stable.\n",
